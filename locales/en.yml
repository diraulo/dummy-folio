I applied for a bootcamp provided by Craft Academy. 12 weeks of a high-paced, information overloaded, emotionally draining rollercoaster at the end of which I will be reborn and remolded as a webdeveloper.

      - Ruby, Ruby on Rails
      - JavaScript, AngularJS, Ionic

      - Test Driven Development
      - Behavior Driven Development
    skills_end: I will be ready to take on any challenge as a junior webdeveloper.
